Version 1.4.3, by Aleksey Cheusov, Fri, 15 Feb 2019 21:09:58 +0300

  Fix parallel build

========================================================================
Version 1.4.2, by Aleksey Cheusov, Wed,  7 Mar 2018 1:10:37 +0300

  Fix build failure on SunOS-5.11 (alloca)

========================================================================
Version 1.4.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Tue, 27 Feb 2018 20:47:19 +0300

  License has been changed from LGPL to MIT, permitted by Rik Faith,
  original author of this library.

  Build system changed from autoshit to mk-configure.

  Library version/soname was bumped from 3 to 4. I cannot
  guarantee that mk-configure and libtool build shared library the
  same way.

  Tests were added for stk_*, mem_* and prm_* functions.

  stk_isempty function was added.

  stk_* and other was reimplemented without obstack functions (glibc
  extension).

========================================================================
Version 1.3.2, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 22 Jul 2012 17:44:37 +0300

  Build failure on cygwin was fixed (sf.net bug #3398121)

  __inline__ directives were removed

========================================================================
Version 1.3.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 22 Oct 2011 12:31:47 +0300

  Build failure with gcc-4.6 was fixed.
  Thanks to Andrey N. Oktyabrski for the report.

========================================================================
Version 1.3.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 10 Apr 2011 17:44:10 +0300

  Only maa's symbols are exported from libmaa shared
  library (export.sym).
  'libtool -export-symbols' is used for this to work.
  |
  DUE TO THIS IN ORDER TO AVOID POTENTIAL ABI INCOMPATIBILITIES, I'VE
  INCREASED MAJOR VERSION OF THE SHARED LIBRARY.

  FIXED: when both stream/file and syslog logging facilities are
  enabled, log_info() and other logging functions segfault on
  NetBSD-5.1/x86_64.  va_copy magic was needed to fix this problem.

  It is assumed that strchr(3) is always available (no autoconf
  check).  The same for unistd.h header file.

  CFLAGS set by user may override default -Wall -Werror set for GCC.

  Fix for warning messages produced by SunPro compiler (integer
  overflow detected: op "<<")

  -c flag was added to INSTALL_DATA invocation

  FIXED: compilation error on CentOS-5.4

  FIXED: "make test" failed on OpenBSD-3.8. This system defines intptr_t
  in inttypes.h, not in stdint.h

========================================================================
Version 1.2.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Wed, 18 Nov 2009 23:12:09 +0200

  For better conformance with POSIX/SUS xmalloc, xrealloc and xcalloc
  functions take 'size_t' args, not 'unsigned int'.
  Due to change in API a major shared library number is bumped from 1 to 2

  New trivial test for log.c

  fix for sltest.c: on OpenBSD intptr_t is defined in stdint.h

  Makefile.in: GNU make is not required anymore, bsd make is enough

========================================================================
Version 1.1.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 31 Jan 2009 21:42:36 +0200

  Makefile and configure fixes and clean-ups:

     LDFLAGS/LIBS passed to configure script are used to build library
     and test utilities

     Other minor clean-ups

  fixed: sf.net bug #2473314, test utility sltest.c failed under
  bigendian platforms.

========================================================================
Version 1.1.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun,  7 Dec 2008 16:14:32 +0200

   lots of code clean-ups

   MAA_TEENY constant added. Now libmaa has version 1.1.0,
   new maa_version_teeny function returns MAA_TEENY

   REMOVED: XTRAHEADERS, TARGETLIBS, RPATHFLAGS configure variables.
   Also removed are  --with-purify, --with-insure, --with-efence,
   --with-checker, --with-local-dmalloc, --with-dmalloc, --with-gprof,
   --with-prof, --with-cflags and --with-cc options.
   Use standard CC, CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS and LIBS variables
   for configuring.

   compilation error on ALTlinux fixed: on latest glibc's write(2) is
   marked as WUR , i.e. return value MUST be checked, otherwise
   warnigns (errors with -Werror) are generated.

   target 'tests' renamed to 'test',
   target 'tests-update' renamed to 'test-update'

   Hash_table statistics is removed from settest.c and hashtest.c
   regression tests.  This is because regression tests fail under
   64-platforms.

   sltest.c (regression test): compilation failure on Linux/x86-64 fixed

   avoid using strdup(3), it is not portable
   (fails under Interix without -D_ALL_SOURCE).
   Another compilation fixes for Interix

   avoid using bcopy(3), use standard memcpy(3) instead

   -Werror is used instead of -pedantic (for gcc only)

   If at least one selftest fails (target 'test'), an exit status of
   'make test' is 1.

   'make test' now works correctly if it is run from
   external obj/ directory

   no '-g' hardcode for !gcc compilers
   no '-g -O' for gcc

========================================================================
Previous versions (1997-2008) were a part of dictd tarball
